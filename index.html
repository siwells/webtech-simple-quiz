        <h1>Super Simple WebTech Quiz</h1>
        <p>Hi folks, welcome to this super simple webtech quiz. It's meant to be a really straightforward proof of concept that demonstrates the simplest kind of online quiz using just some HTML tags.</p>
        <p>Obviously there are many ways to build a quiz site, and each addition of a technology, e.g. CSS or JS, gives you additional power to express your ideas, or to do things in different ways. Sometimes it can be just as instructive to ask yourself, "if I only had HTML, how would I solve this problem?". In addition, a reasonable starting place, especially when you're still uncertain of how things fit together, is to start simple. Once you have a simple working solution you then have a starting place for posing the question "how else could I solve this problem?".</p>
